# Chinook SQL Exercises

[chinook_queries.sql](https://github.com/martinaspeciale/exercises/blob/main/sql/chinook_queries.sql) contains a structured set of SQL exercises based on the [Chinook Database](https://www.timestored.com/data/sample/chinook.db). The Chinook DB simulates a digital music store with data on artists, albums, customers, invoices, and tracks.

Each level introduces progressively more advanced SQL concepts, and is designed for practice, learning, and demonstration purposes.
